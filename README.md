# TakingOnLineTest_MadeEasy
This python program takes a snapshot of the screen,  uses an open sourceOCR Capture2Text to parse image into text, then save it to a JSON file with keyword and frequency. When taking the test, it can tell you 1.  which previous picture has the best match in keywords to answer your question (keyword match >50%) 2. which picture is irrelevant (keyword match < 20%)
